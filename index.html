            Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits and manifests in various forms. Formal education occurs within a structured institutional framework, such as public schools, following a curriculum. Non-formal education also follows a structured approach but occurs outside the formal schooling system, while informal education entails unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and non-formal education are categorized into levels, including early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on teaching methods, such as teacher-centered and student-centered education, and on subjects, such as science education, language education, and physical education. Additionally, the term "education" can denote the mental states and qualities of educated individuals and the academic field studying educational phenomena.

            Educational technology (commonly abbreviated as edutech, or edtech) is the combined use of computer hardware, software, and educational theory and practice to facilitate learning. When referred to with its abbreviation, "EdTech," it often refers to the industry of companies that create educational technology.In EdTech Inc.: Selling, Automating and Globalizing Higher Education in the Digital Age, Tanner Mirrlees and Shahid Alvi (2019) argue "EdTech is no exception to industry ownership and market rules" and "define the EdTech industries as all the privately owned companies currently involved in the financing, production and distribution of commercial hardware, software, cultural goods, services and platforms for the educational market with the goal of turning a profit. Many of these companies are US-based and rapidly expanding into educational markets across North America, and increasingly growing all over the world.

            The role of innovation in education is crucial for ensuring equal access to essential tools that can have a significant impact on the lives of both educators and students. To develop effective strategies that cater to the specific needs of a developing society, several important themes can be identified. One such theme is the necessity to provide students with access to appropriate learning materials, particularly in their native languages, as this facilitates better comprehension of subjects. In this context, it is essential for education to adopt a humanistic approach, particularly in light of the increasing prominence of digital technologies.

            An example of the application of innovative technology in education is the implementation of an AI-based tutoring system at an entry-level IT school in Pensacola by the U.S. Navy. This system incorporates a human tutor who closely monitors the progress of the students and provides individual assessments. According to the Navy, students who utilised the digital tutoring system consistently achieved higher test scores compared to those who did not use the digital tutor. The adaptive nature of the technology appears to have a positive impact on students, as it can assist individuals with diverse learning styles and better equip them to learn independently.
